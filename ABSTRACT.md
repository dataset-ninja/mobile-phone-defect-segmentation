The **MSD: Mobile Phone Defect Segmentation Dataset** aims to alleviate the scarcity of data in the realm of industrial quality control. It comprises three distinct surface defect types: *oil*, *scratch*, and *stain*, with 400 images for each defect, totaling 1200 images. These images are captured using an industrial camera at a resolution of 1920Ã—1080 and follow the PASCAL VOC dataset format. Furthermore, the dataset includes 20 supplementary non-defective images, which can be valuable for unsupervised setting.

Surface defect detection stands as a common yet demanding task with the vital need for accuracy and real-time capabilities. Nonetheless, prevailing segmentation networks grapple with challenges related to defect boundary intricacies, local similarities among diverse defects, and the often meager contrast between defects and their background. Addressing these issues, the authors introduce **FDSNet** network both with the MSD dataset.
